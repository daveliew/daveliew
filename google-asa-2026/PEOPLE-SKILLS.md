# People Skills & Stakeholder Management for L4 SA

Balances technical prep with the human side of the role.

---

## The SA Role Reality

Solutions Architects are **bridges**, not pure engineers:
- Translate client pain → technical solutions
- Navigate internal teams (Sales, Product, Engineering, Support)
- Build trust so clients listen to your recommendations
- Often the "face of Google" to advertisers

**Interview signal**: Can this person represent us to clients AND work effectively internally?

---

## The Four Interview Pillars (Reframed)

| Pillar | Technical View | People View |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **RRK** | Know the stack | Can you explain it to a non-technical client? |
| **GCA** | Solve problems | Do you ask good clarifying questions? Stay calm under ambiguity? |
| **Leadership** | Technical ownership | Influencing without authority, mentoring, championing ideas |
| **Googleyness** | Bias to action | Collaboration, intellectual humility, helping others succeed |

---

## Demonstrating "Peopleness"

### What They're Looking For

- **Empathy**: Understanding the client's business context, not just their technical problem
- **Active listening**: Clarifying before solving
- **Patience**: Explaining complex things simply, multiple times if needed
- **Trust-building**: Being honest about limitations, following through on commitments

### Interview Signals

**Strong**: "I noticed the client was frustrated, so I first acknowledged their situation before diving into troubleshooting..."

**Weak**: "I fixed the tag implementation issue using..."

### STAR Story Prompts

- Time you turned an unhappy client into an advocate
- Time you had to deliver bad news (timeline slip, limitation, etc.)
- Time you simplified a complex technical concept for a non-technical stakeholder
- Time you built trust with someone who was initially skeptical of you

---

## Cross-Functional Stakeholder Management

### The Reality of XFN Work

You'll work with people who have:
- Different priorities (Sales wants speed, Engineering wants quality)
- Different knowledge levels (Technical vs. non-technical)
- Different incentives (Quotas vs. product roadmaps vs. client satisfaction)

### Key Skills to Demonstrate

| Skill | How to Show It |
|-------|----------------|
| **Influencing without authority** | Got another team to prioritize something without being their manager |
| **Managing up** | Kept leadership informed, escalated appropriately |
| **Navigating conflict** | Two stakeholders wanted opposite things - how did you resolve? |
| **Building coalitions** | Got multiple teams aligned on a shared goal |
| **Setting expectations** | Managed scope/timeline when stakeholders wanted more |

### STAR Story Prompts

- Time you influenced another team to change their approach
- Time you had to push back on a stakeholder request
- Time you aligned multiple teams with competing priorities
- Time you escalated effectively (not too early, not too late)
- Time you said "no" diplomatically and offered alternatives

---

## Technical Credibility (Without Faking It)

### The Goal

Show you have enough depth to:
- Ask intelligent questions
- Spot issues others might miss
- Provide value beyond reading documentation

But also show you:
- Know what you don't know
- Can learn rapidly
- Don't pretend expertise you don't have

### The "I Don't Know" Framework

When you don't know something in an interview:

1. **Acknowledge honestly**: "I haven't worked with that specific tool, but..."
2. **Connect to what you know**: "...it sounds similar to X which I've used, where..."
3. **Show your approach**: "...my first step would be to check the docs for Y, then..."
4. **Demonstrate curiosity**: "...I'd be curious whether it handles Z the same way."

**Example**:
> "I haven't implemented Consent Mode v2 specifically, but I've built similar consent frameworks at Meta using their Limited Data Use mode. My approach would be to first understand Google's four consent signals, test in a staging environment, and validate with the Tag Assistant debugger. What's the client's specific consent management platform?"

### What NOT to Do

- Pretend you know something you don't (they'll probe deeper)
- Give vague non-answers ("it depends...")
- Panic and go silent
- Over-qualify everything ("I'm not sure but maybe...")

---

## Learning Agility

### What It Looks Like

- Quickly grasping new concepts during the interview itself
- Asking clarifying questions that show you're building a mental model
- Connecting new information to existing knowledge
- Admitting when you've learned something new

### Interview Signals

**Strong**: "Oh interesting, so GA4's event model is more like Meta's custom events than UA's pageview-centric approach. That helps me understand why the BigQuery schema is structured that way."

**Weak**: "I'd need to study that more before I could answer."

### STAR Story Prompts

- Time you had to learn a new technology/domain quickly
- Time you were thrown into something unfamiliar and succeeded
- Time you asked for help and it accelerated your learning
- Time you taught yourself something that wasn't documented

---

## Reframing Your Meta Experience

Your Meta background isn't a gap - it's **cross-platform expertise**.

### Strong Framing

> "My Meta experience means I understand measurement from multiple angles. I know why platform-reported conversions differ from GA4 - it's attribution philosophy, not tracking error. This helps me set realistic expectations with clients who advertise across platforms."

> "At Meta, I worked with advertisers who also used Google Ads. I helped them understand why the numbers differ and how to think about incrementality rather than counting the same conversion twice."

> "Server-side measurement concepts are platform-agnostic. My CAPI experience translates directly to Enhanced Conversions - same infrastructure pattern, different endpoint."

### Avoid

- Apologizing for not knowing Google stack
- Over-explaining Meta concepts (they may not know/care)
- Treating it as "less relevant" experience

---

## The Googleyness Signals (Human Side)

### What Google Actually Cares About

| Trait | What It Means | How to Show |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Bias to action** | Don't wait for permission, try things | "I didn't wait for approval, I prototyped and showed results" |
| **Comfort with ambiguity** | Stay calm when things are unclear | "When requirements were fuzzy, I started with assumptions and iterated" |
| **Collaboration** | Help others succeed, not just yourself | "I documented it so the next person wouldn't hit the same issue" |
| **Intellectual humility** | Know what you don't know | "I realized my initial assumption was wrong, so I..." |
| **Constructive dissent** | Challenge ideas respectfully | "I disagreed with the approach and explained why, then proposed..." |

### Red Flags They Watch For

- Taking sole credit ("I did everything")
- Blaming others ("The other team didn't...")
- Avoiding accountability ("It wasn't my responsibility")
- Rigid thinking ("That's not how we did it at Meta")

---

## Interview Day Reminders

### Before Each Round

- Take a breath
- Remember: they WANT you to succeed
- You're interviewing them too

### During Technical Questions

- Think out loud
- Ask clarifying questions BEFORE diving in
- It's okay to say "Let me think about that for a moment"
- Connect to real experience when possible

### During Behavioral Questions

- Use STAR but keep it conversational
- Quantify impact when possible
- Show what YOU did, not just the team
- Include what you learned

### When You Don't Know

- "I haven't worked with that specifically, but here's how I'd approach it..."
- "That's a great question - I'd want to understand X before answering..."
- "I'm not certain, but my hypothesis would be... and I'd validate by..."

## Quick Reference: Story Bank

Prepare 4-5 stories that can flex across multiple questions:

| Story Theme | Can Answer |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Turned unhappy client around** | People skills, conflict, communication |
| **Learned something fast** | Learning agility, ambiguity, GCA |
| **Influenced another team** | Leadership, XFN, collaboration |
| **Made a mistake and recovered** | Humility, learning, ownership |
| **Championed an unpopular idea** | Constructive dissent, bias to action |

Each story should have:
- Clear situation/context (2 sentences max)
- Your specific actions (not "we")
- Quantified or concrete outcome
- What you learned / would do differently
