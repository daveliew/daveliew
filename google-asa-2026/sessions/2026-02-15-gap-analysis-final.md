**Interview**: Sunday, Feb 16 @ 10:30am | **HM**: Rohan Dhanuka | **Time remaining**: ~15 hours

## Story Lineup Correction

**Your Round 3 Final Stories** (verified from `ROUND3_FINAL_IDS`):

| # | ID | Title | Primary Angles |
|---|-----|-------|----------------|
| 1 | **sgcc-smu** | SMU Pivot — Convincing Co-Founder | Conflict, Influence, Revenue Pressure |
| 2 | **gt-mapi** | Lazada Merchant API — Hygiene to Headroom | Initiative, Enabling Others |
| 3 | **mt-shein** | SHEIN API Ramp — Wrong Door | Above & Beyond, Pattern Recognition |
| 4 | **lli-voice** | LLI Voice AI — Setting Boundaries | Pushing Back, Scope Protection |
| 5 | **ntuc-nav** | NTUC Service Navigator | Ambiguity, Scope Trade-offs |

**Mental correction**: `lli-voice` is in your top 5, not `gt-shp`. The gt-shp story (Shopee Price Mismatch) was used in Round 2 and deprioritized.

- [ ] **Correct mental model** — lli-voice is #4, not gt-shp — 2 min

## Story Reframes Quick Reference

| Story | Reframes Available |
|-------|-------------------|
| sgcc-smu | Failure, D&C, Conflict, Revenue Pressure |
