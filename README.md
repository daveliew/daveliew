# Hi 👋 I'm @daveliew
## I'm learning to code as a professional. I have experiences in the business side of startups, incl. sales, digital marketing and finance.
#### I'd love to contribute to open source projects to level up my skills. I am a fan of the MERN stack, but also dabble in occassional Python NLP explorations.
> I've graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp (Aug 2021)!
