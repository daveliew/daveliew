## 🎯 Core Frameworks

### Context Engineering
Right context, right time, right format

Structured approach to AI-assisted development that treats context as the primary input. Better context = better AI outputs = faster shipping.

### Three Hat Method
**Systems Architect:** Design scalable, maintainable systems
**Product Manager:** Prioritize ruthlessly, ship what matters
**Implementation:** Write production code that works

*Switching hats deliberately based on what the problem needs*
