### What I Do

I help businesses implement AI that actually ships. Context engineering, multi-agent systems, and turning ambiguity into working software.

**Current projects:** [Agentic Brewery](https://agenticbrewery.ai) (consulting) · [Ray of Joy](https://rayofjoytherapy.com) (healthcare) · [TSS](https://www.thesustainabilityservice.org) (ESG)
