# David Liew - Systems Implementation Pioneer ðŸ§ Ã—ðŸ¤–

> Building at the intersection of Human Intelligence and AI. I ship in weeks what others plan for months.

## ðŸŽ¯ Human+AI Synthesis in Action

I'm ALL-IN on human-AI collaboration, using:
- **Claude Desktop + Claude Code** for AI-powered development
- **Cursor IDE** with Composer for 10x coding velocity  
- **MCP Servers** for seamless AI-data integration
- **CrewAI + n8n** for workflow automation

*Not just using AI tools - architecting human-AI systems that actually ship.*

## ðŸš€ Currently Building

### [Agentic Brewery](https://agenticbrewery.com)
AI implementation foundry - rapid prototyping meets strategic consulting. I build POCs in days that validate ideas, then scale what works. Sometimes this leads to fractional CTO engagements.

### [The Sustainability Service](https://thesustainabilityservice.com)
AI-powered ESG assessment platform. Claude API + Vector Embeddings = actionable sustainability insights.

### Active Client Work
- **Ray of Joy Therapy** - AI-enhanced assessment tools + responsive web platform
- **Enterprise AI Workshops** - Helping 1000+ employee companies architect human-AI collaboration
- **Multiple SME MVPs** - From concept to production in weeks, not months

## ðŸ’¡ The Implementation Stack

```javascript
const currentStack = {
  ai: ['Claude API', 'OpenAI', 'MCP Servers', 'Vector DBs'],
  development: ['Cursor IDE', 'Claude Desktop', 'Claude Code'],
  web: ['Next.js', 'React', 'TypeScript', 'Tailwind'],
  backend: ['Supabase', 'PostgreSQL', 'Airtable'],
  automation: ['n8n', 'Make.com', 'Zapier'],
  deployment: ['Vercel', 'Netlify']
}

const philosophy = "Implementation > Theory. Always."
